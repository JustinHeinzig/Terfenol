Note about the GitHub: I've wasted close to 20 hours trying to get GitHub to work. The nail in the coffin was when I couldn't delete a commit and soft-locked my computer out of GitHub. I also fully realized what it means that you must have the entire repository stored on your local machine, not tenable for UE game development. As of Sunday 11/12, me and my partner discovered an alternative: Perforce, which we're going to try to adopt. We're also going to use the UE collaboration tools. For now and the near future, we will still submit with GitHub by dragging and dropping the bare minimum files. GitHub LIMITS EVEN LFS TO 1GiB, SO I CAN'T UPLOAD MY GAME, WHICH IS 25GiB.
